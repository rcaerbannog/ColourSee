FileChooser.getMediaDirectory() controls how files are chosen.
If there is time, re-implement the ZOOM bar in Level or the level creator

TODO:

Apply color filter to the buttons

Implement lens button in paletteBox, set icon as a magnifying glass image
Restore the getMediaDirectory method to access the images folder

Clean up ButtonMenu format: get it working goddamnit


Procedure for using lens and colour filter:
-Apply colour filter to all colours, including on image and on buttons
-When lens is clicked, apply an undo filter to the image and change the colour of each palette button
-When lens is deactivated, apply the colour filter to the image and change the colour of each palette button
-When level ends, apply an undo filter to the image, THEN evaluate the colours
If needed, store TWO lists of pixels in the picture: filter colour and normal colour
And use the fill method TWICE, once on filtered array with appear colours, once on normal array with actual color



IDEA:
in ColorOracle program, use Simulator program (creates the filtered image)
Use its methods to generate a BufferedImage to display
When lens is pressed, switch it with the original image
When doing fill method, refer to pixel of original image
Find a way to get filtered colour to apply to buttons

DIRECTORY FORMAT
Levels folder
    worldList.txt
    levelsList.txt
    [level folders: can be sth like "1-3" or "custom-2", name not necessary]
        levelInfo.dat
        palette.dat
        levelIMG.png (must be named levelIMG.png)

Automatically display labels with correct button label at key points
(These labels should have a transparent/no background




The JAR file should run
The program files should be in a project compatible with NetBeans, DrJava, or Eclipse
IntelliJ will not work

Note: fill can fill out border. Change so fill doesn't work on border colour.

  COMPLETE:
  Create filters for:
  Deuteranopia (red-green)
  Protanopia (red-green)
  Tritanopia (blue-yellow)
  Grayscale (achromatopsia)
  (These are the most severe forms)

  Get values from other CB filters
